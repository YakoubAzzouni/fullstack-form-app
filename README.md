# fullstack-form-app
This project is a full-stack web application designed to demonstrate how to build, connect, and deploy a modern CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system. It allows users to submit a form with five fields (FirstName, LastName, email, age, phone, and city), store the data in a PostgreSQL database, and manage submissions through a simple React interface.
